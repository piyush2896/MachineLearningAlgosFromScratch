# Machine Learning Algorithms From Scratch
This repository contains some machine learning algorithms wrote from scratch in Python using NumPy only.

## Algorithms Available
1. [Gradient Descent](./GradientDescent)
2. [K-Means Clustering](./KMeans)
3. [K-Nearest Neighbor](./KNN)
4. [Naive Bayes](./NaiveBayes)
5. [Decision Trees](./DecisionTrees)
6. [Neural Networks](./NeuralNetwork)
7. [Single Linkage Clustering](./SingleLinkageClustering)
8. [Soft Clustering](./SoftClustering)
9. [Support Vector Machine](./SVM)
10. Convolutional Neural Networks - These weren't complete, although I implemented a complete ConvNet in different repository linked [here](https://github.com/piyush2896/CNN-Using-Numpy).

## Dependencies
1. NumPy
